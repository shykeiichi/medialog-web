I think executed with a little more planning it would be one of my favourites and while it's still nowhere near mid or lower tier by rating it's definentally lower than it could be because of it's pacing issues that have already been complained about to death so i'm not going to go into it. If you look beyond the pacing issues you have a good show with great animation as is excpected from A1 Pictures and has some of the best fight scenes i have seen in anime which is what carries it. The idea is also amazing and has got me thinking what it would be like to be in real life which is hard to come by because SAO is so fictional yet feels so real in a sense because it's premise is that it's in a game which gets me hopeful that someday we can surpass that and that i can experience SAO for myself.

I felt like i missed an episode explaining what was happening i don't know if i'm just too dense to understand it but it felt like it was at a lower standard than the rest of the show. Speaking of the rest of the show i really enjoyed it. It a mech fighting show in the beginning with some story elements with some mystery looming about that you figured out towards the end which was nice. Going into it i thought it was going to be a numb mech fighting show with a big grand battle at the end which was far from what i got which was a good suprise. I get why so many people find this show to be one of their favourites but i can't really put it up there myself. Maybe it's because i'm watching this in a completely different anime climate than when the show was created because i felt like it would be good to have a little less alien fights as they get abit boring with the Alien Appears -> Evas Engage -> Something Goes Wrong -> They win in the beginning which changes towards the middle when the angels start to appear as if they can evolve which reimbursed my attention for the show.

The writing, storytelling, the amazing animation, it all comes together to make a show which I hold so close to my heart that I can't explain. I know what will happen and i can map out the story event for event but I always come back to watching it once a year as comfort even when the sadness still creeps in the shadows. There are few shows I've watched where it feels flawless it might be nostalgia but I have watched few shows where I feel like there was no filler or loose plot line. There are also few shows where I can sing the OP without any support which I think shows something. The piano and violin playing is also top notch and I would really like to be able to play like Kousei sometime in my life but I don't think I have it in me.

Tying up all loose ends was really satisfying and it wasn't bad in the slightest i expected it to be a little more underwhealming but it felt really good and the fact that Jesse was free in the end was nice. Honestly great fucking show and i wouldn't say it has the rewatch value that i would like i think it's because of the length or that it had ALOT of filler which i feel could be cut but i don't see it as wasted time as i have with some other shows. Either way final verdict of the entire series is that i really really liked it but i can't really say that i would rewatch it in the near future. Can't say if it's because of the filler or the length i think it's the first option as i have rewatched Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood a show which has a similar length about 4 times and i have loved it each time which makes it so that i will need to dock some points from breaking bad but i still really loved it."}}}, "gravity falls": {"disname": "Gravity Falls", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "Disney", "rating": 81, "notes": "Gravity Falls season 1 is a classic disney show.

I am largely intreagued by the plot of Ford and Bill Cipher throughout the show and it's what keeps me going watching but i don't think that i would watch Gravity Falls nowadays if i hadn't had previous experiences with it at a younger age as the first season doesn't really develop the characters other than Dippers love for Wendy and their collective hate for Gideon.

It is however a stunning movie and i enjoyed it throughout it wasnt a movie i skipped parts of because they were boring it was just nothing special. The acting and cinematography was good though and its well written and maybe it's just not for me."}}}, "intouchables": {"disname": "En Ov\u00e4ntad V\u00e4nskap", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}}}, "to kill a mockingbird": {"disname": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "", "rating": 82, "notes": "This was a really good movie. It wasn't anything outstanding but i can see why its a must watch. Ofcourse i know that the visuals are a product of it's time and i won't be docking points because of that. The story was however really good and i really enjoyed it paints a picture of early 20th century USA and it's a really good watch. The pacing is a little slow by modern standards but its excpected being 60 years old this year. Either way great movie but just not something i can see myself watching again but still something i liked watching."}}}, "only the brave": {"disname": "Only the brave", "status": "planned", "seasons": {}}}, "book": {"neeko wa tsurai yo": {"disname": "Neeko wa Tsurai yo", "status": "watching", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "aldehyde", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}}}, "fukakai na boku no subete o": {"disname": "Fukakai na boku no subete o", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "konayama, kata", "rating": 89, "notes": "This manga really gave me the feels towards the end and i guess every series must have a happy ending. I really liked the characters and although I usually avoid cutesy cafe manga/anime stuff since I usually find them annoying, since Fukakai na boku. focuses more on the relations between the characters and had major scenes outside of the cafe. I found that it strengthened the story rather than making it bloated with nyan uwu stuff. Also i have to talk about the elephant in the room which is Mogumo and the other characters like Satori because hgnnnnnn they pass so well and id be lying if i wasnt a bit envious still cis tho. Mogumo is just so cute with their hair up and in one of the later chapters when Sakura helps style them i got really envious because of ze cuteness but i also got some stuff i'm worrying about in the show since im prolly mtf let's be honest future me and this made me reflect on how coming out as a fellow tomato might disrupt my future life but i'd hope if you are reading this you already have like id hope so wanna go on hrt before 2030. Either way if i'm not a tomato and i'm writing this in vain i hope you had a nice laugh of how much i'm stressing rn. But either way it was a really good manga and the characters are well written and cutely drawn like I mentioned when Mogumo got dressed by Sakura and I'm probably gonna read the sequel sometime later.

I guess my future self will know if it's dysphoria or attraction I feel towards Yuu but I feel like its dysphoria and I'm sorry for the inevitable cringe I'm putting on older me rn but hang with me. Either way i really liked the manga and the relationship between Touko and \tYuu is really genuine and i want please is to much to ask. OK FUCK IM TALKING ALOT ABOUT ME WANTING TO BE A GIRL STILL CIS THO. Either way their relationship is really cute and I really liked the ending in Chapter 45 which plays out a few years into the future where they go back to the location of the manga and visit the cultural festival of the school they went to. Its a really sweet and good ending to end on and I can't really think of a better way to do it as it didn't feel out of place. Either way, for the first manga I really enjoyed it and the whole relationship between Touko and Yuu is really heartwarming and I'll probably come back to the spinoffs later on."}}}, "ttiwbbtcgtb": {"disname": "TTIWBBTCGTB", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}, "2": {"disname": "2", "studio": "Studio Hibari", "rating": 1, "notes": ""}}}, "whisper you a love song": {"disname": "Whisper you a love song", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}}}, "throw away the suit together": {"disname": "Throw Away The Suit Together", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"1": {"disname": "1", "studio": "", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}}}, "umibe no etranger": {"disname": "The Stranger by the Beach", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"vol 1": {"disname": "vol 1", "studio": "Kanna Kii", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}, "vol 2": {"disname": "vol 2", "studio": "Kanna Kii", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}, "vol 3": {"disname": "vol 3", "studio": "Kanna Kii", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}, "vol 4": {"disname": "vol 4", "studio": "Kanna Kii", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}, "vol 5": {"disname": "vol 5", "studio": "Kanna Kii", "rating": 0, "notes": ""}}}, "heartstopper": {"disname": "Heartstopper", "status": "planned", "seasons": {"vol 1": {"disname": "Vol 1", "studio": "Alice Oseman", "rating": 95, "notes": "Volume 1 of Heartstopper was really good. Ofcourse it is a comic which gives it alot less space than a normal book with a dialogue being one page instead of one paragraph but i really enjoyed it. I read it in about 40-45 minutes and was hooked all the way through and i really loved the character development throught and seing Charlie become friends with Nick and them being really cute togeher was reallllly cute and i wish i could read it again for the first time. The art was also really good and i'm going to look forward to reading the second volume when it comes in store.

I read it just as fast as the first volume and it still feels short. Ofcourse this is excpected of a comic book as they have the words a normal book can write in two chapters on a whole book but it's still finominal. Where the first book shows Nick and Charlie become close friends and then kissing in the end which builds up throughout the book. To volume 2 where they are a private couple at first and it's really sweet seeing them both together. The middle of the book was by far my favourite when they start being really sweet with eachother and when they have their first real 'date' on the beach which is my favourite 'scene' so far. I will definentaly read volume 3 as fast as i can get my hands on it as i really want to get to read what happens next which isn't something that i really do with books so great job!"}}}, "death troopers": {"disname": "Death Troopers", "status": "planned", "seasons": {}}}, "podcast": {}}
